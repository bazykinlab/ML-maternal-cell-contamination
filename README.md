# ML-maternal-cell-contamination

This repository consists of two parts:

1. Utilities for:
	* Working with VCF files
	* Using a pretrained model to recalibrate the genotype (GATK output) of a contaminated sample
	* Training your own model on synthetic data

2. Notebooks to reproduce our results from the corresponding paper. See `notebooks/example.ipynb` for a demonstration of the usage of the scripts.
